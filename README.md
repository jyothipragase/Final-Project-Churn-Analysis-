**CUSTOMER CHURN PROJECT**

**Problem Statement**
The problem at hand is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company. The company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, resulting in significant revenue loss. The management wants to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rate and increase customer retention. The dataset provided includes information about customers, such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and customer churn status.

AIM: The challenge is to analyze this dataset using data analytics techniques and uncover insights that can help the company understand the drivers of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

**The project aims to answer the following questions**
1. What are the primary factors influencing customer churn? Are there any specific patterns or correlations in the data that indicate churn-prone customers?
2. Can we identify any demographic or behavioral characteristics that differentiate churned customers from those who continue to be active?
3. Are there any specific services or contract terms that contribute significantly to customer churn? Are there opportunities to modify or enhance these offerings to reduce churn?
4. Can we build a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer churn? What are the key features or variables that contribute most to the predictive accuracy of the model?
