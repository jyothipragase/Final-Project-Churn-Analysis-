**CUSTOMER CHURN PROJECT**

**Problem Statement**
The problem at hand is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company. The company is experiencing a high rate of customer churn, resulting in significant revenue loss. The management wants to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rate and increase customer retention. The dataset provided includes information about customers, such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and customer churn status.

**AIM:** The challenge is to analyze this dataset using data analytics techniques and uncover insights that can help the company understand the drivers of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

# Data Preparation
 I imported the data into Power BI and transformed it on Power Query as follows:
- Next, I eliminated the auto-generated header, by promoting the first row of my data to become the header.
- Using the given datasets, I have cleaned and removed the Null values and Blank values.
- With the project objective in mind, I sought to eliminate any data that would be irrelevant to my analysis.

# Data Transformation
 Here, I created Queries to organise data for better analysis and reporting.

-So I created a various calculated measures to create a required fields to create a insights and the required visualization, so I renamed the columns where needed, so they are meaningful enough when they appear as title in the charts.
